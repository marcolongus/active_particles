## concave.py

This script provides a way to visualize the animation of points and compute the area of the concave hull in parallel. By using Matplotlib and AlphaShapes, it is possible to visualize the evolution of the concave hull over time and save the area of the concave hull at each time step.

## concave_optimazed.py

This script use a different library to parallelize the calculation.
